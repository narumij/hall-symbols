# hall-symbols

Haskell Hall Symbols Library

## Quickstart

Make new stack project and move to project directory.

```shell
% stack new hmRepl
% cd hmRepl
```

Edit resolver part like below
```
# resolver: lts-16.6
resolver: nightly-2020-07-23
```

Edit dependencies part of package.yaml like below.

```
dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- matrix-as-xyz
- symmetry-operations-symbols
- hall-symbols
```

Then start repl.

```shell
% stack repl
```

Setup packages and load modules.

```haskell
repl> :m Data.Matrix.AsXYZ Data.Matrix.SymmetryOperationsSymbols Crystallography.HallSymbols
```

Use like below.

```haskell
-- print General Positions.
repl> prettyXYZ <$> fromHallSymbols' "C -2yc"
 ["x,y,z","x+1/2,y+1/2,z","x,-y,z+1/2","x+1/2,-y+1/2,z+1/2"]

repl> fromHallSymbols' "C -2yc" >>= fromMatrix'
[" 1 "," c  x,0,z"," t (1/2,1/2,0) "," n (1/2,0,1/2) x,1/4,z"]

```

Or use like below.

```haskell
-- print Generators
repl> prettyXYZ <$> generatorsOfHallSymbols "C -2yc"
["x,y,z","x+1/2,y+1/2,z","x,-y,z+1/2"]

repl> generatorsOfHallSymbols "C -2yc" >>= fromMatrix'
[" 1 "," t (1/2,1/2,0) "," c  x,0,z"]

```
